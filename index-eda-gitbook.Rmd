# Welcome to CDI – From Reads to Insights in RNA-Seq

This guide helps you explore RNA-Seq datasets from count matrices to quality control. You'll gain confidence in examining expression patterns and preparing gene-level summaries for downstream use.

## 📚 The CDI Learning Path

This guide is part of the **CDI layered learning system**, where insights from complex data are explored step by step through four progressive layers:

- **🔍 EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** – Start here. Understand your data, its structure, and quirks.
- **📊 VIZ (Visualization)** – Learn how to communicate patterns and insights visually.
- **📐 STATS (Statistical Analysis)** – Apply statistical methods to test hypotheses and quantify uncertainty.
- **🤖 ML (Machine Learning)** – Use models to predict, classify, and extract deeper meaning.

You’re currently reading the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) layer — the free, open-access starting point of the CDI layered learning system.

Whether you're preparing for a remote role, analyzing real-world data, or mentoring others, CDI helps you grow — one Q&A at a time.
