# Getting Started: Preparing RNA-Seq Data for Analysis {-#getting-started}

## Prerequisite {-}

Before using this CDI Q&A guide, you need input files that are typically generated from an upstream RNA-Seq pipeline (e.g., using **STAR**, **featureCounts**, or **HTSeq-count**):

- `counts.csv` — the raw gene count matrix (genes × samples)  
- `metadata.csv` — sample information, including experimental condition or batch  

> 🎯 **Note:** Each user may have their own preferred tools and pipelines to generate these files. That part is considered background work and is **not covered** in this guide.  
> Once you have these two input files, you're ready to enter the **CDI Q&A learning ecosystem**.

## Step 1: Run DESeq2 in R {-}

To generate the analysis-ready files for use in this Q&A guide, run the provided R script using the command line:

```bash
Rscript scripts/res-df.R
```

🔧 This script will:

> - Load `counts.csv` and `metadata.csv`
> - Run DESeq2 for differential expression analysis
> - Save cleaned outputs to the `data/` folder

## Output Files {-}

After running the script, your `data/` folder will contain:

- ✅ `demo_counts.csv` — the (optionally cleaned) count matrix  
- ✅ `demo_metadata.csv` — the sample metadata  
- ✅ `deseq2_results.csv` — DESeq2 differential expression results

## Quick Glimpse: How the Demo Data Was Generated {-}

The RNA-Seq dataset used in this guide was generated using a standard, reproducible pipeline. This overview is provided for transparency—you do **not** need to reproduce these steps to follow the guide.

- 🧪 **Data type**: Paired-end RNA-Seq  
- ✂️ **Preprocessing**: Adapter trimming performed with **Cutadapt**  
- 🚀 **Alignment**: Reads were mapped to the *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* genome using **STAR**  
- 🛠 **Pipeline orchestration**: Implemented using **Snakemake** from the Workflow Catalog  
- 📊 **Quantification**: Gene counts were generated by STAR and compiled into a TSV table  
- 📈 **Differential Expression**: Conducted with **DESeq2** using the official Bioconductor guidelines  
- ⚙️ **Parallelization**: The DESeq2 step was assigned **3 CPU cores**

✅ **You are now ready to begin the CDI Q&A journey**, exploring and visualizing RNA-Seq results using **Python, R, and Bash**.
