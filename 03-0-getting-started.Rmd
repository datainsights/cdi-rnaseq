# RNA-Seq Analysis Pipeline {-}

## Materials and Methods {-}

A typical RNA-Seq dataset is generated using a standard, reproducible pipeline. Below is an overview of the materials and methods used to generate the demo dataset in this guide. This information is provided for transparency—**you do not need to reproduce these steps** to follow the Q&A guide.

- 🧪 **Data Type**: Paired-end RNA-Seq  
- ✂️ **Preprocessing**: Adapter trimming performed with **Cutadapt**  
- 🚀 **Alignment**: Reads aligned to the *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* genome using **STAR**  
- 🛠 **Pipeline Orchestration**: Managed using **Snakemake** (from the Workflow Catalog)  
- 📊 **Quantification**: Gene counts generated directly by STAR and compiled into a TSV table  
- 📈 **Differential Expression**: Performed with **DESeq2** following Bioconductor best practices  
- ⚙️ **Parallelization**: DESeq2 assigned **3 CPU cores** for efficiency

## Output of the RNA-Seq Pipeline {-}

Before starting downstream analysis, you will need output files generated from the upstream RNA-Seq workflow (e.g., STAR + featureCounts or HTSeq-count):

- `counts.csv` — a raw gene count matrix (genes × samples)  
- `metadata.csv` — sample metadata including condition, group, or batch information  

> 🎯 **Note:** Each user may rely on different pipelines or tools to generate these files. That upstream processing is considered **background work** and is not covered in this guide.  
> Once you have these two input files, you’re ready to enter the **CDI Q&A learning ecosystem**, which guides you through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **Visualization (VIZ)**, **Statistical Analysis (STATS)**, and **Machine Learning (ML)**.

✅ **You are now ready to begin the CDI Q&A journey**, exploring and interpreting RNA-Seq results using **R, Python, and Bash**.

The next sections will guide you—question by question—with clear explanations, reproducible code, and visuals.
