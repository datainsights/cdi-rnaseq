You’ll gain confidence in examining expression patterns and preparing gene-level summaries for downstream use. 1.2 📚 The CDI Learning Path This guide is part of the CDI layered learning system, where insights from complex data are explored step by step through four progressive layers: 🔍 EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) – Start here. Understand your data, its structure, and quirks. 📊 VIZ (Visualization) – Learn how to communicate patterns and insights visually. 📐 STATS (Statistical Analysis) – Apply statistical methods to test hypotheses and quantify uncertainty. 🤖 ML (Machine Learning) – Use models to predict, classify, and extract deeper meaning. You’re currently reading the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) layer — the free, open-access starting point of the CDI layered learning system. Whether you’re preparing for a remote role, analyzing real-world data, or mentoring others, CDI helps you grow — one Q&amp;A at a time.
