# ðŸŒ± Welcome to the RNA-Seq Q&A Guide {-}

This guide is your hands-on companion for learning and applying RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data analysis â€” one question at a time.

You'll explore each step of the RNA-Seq pipeline using real tools, reproducible workflows, and well-commented code. From quality control and quantification to differential expression and biological interpretation, this guide shows how scripting, statistics, and bioinformatics come together in practice.

Whether youâ€™re a student, researcher, or self-taught enthusiast, youâ€™ll gain confidence using Python, R, shell scripting, and reproducible workflows â€” including tools like **DESeq2**, **Salmon**, **edgeR**, **FastQC**, **Snakemake**, and more.

Each Q&A includes a clear explanation, relevant code in both Python and R when applicable, and builds toward real-world problem solving. You're not just learning RNA-Seq â€” you're learning to think like a modern data-driven bioinformatician.
