# (PART) DIFFERENTIAL GENE EXPRESSION {-}

# How do you perform differential gene expression analysis using DESeq2?

## Explanation

Once the count matrix and sample metadata are properly loaded and matched, we use **DESeq2** to identify genes that are significantly differentially expressed between experimental conditions.

DESeq2 performs a robust, multi-step process:

1. 📊 **Estimates size factors** to normalize for library depth  
2. 🔁 **Calculates dispersion** for each gene to model biological variability  
3. ⚙️ **Fits a negative binomial generalized linear model (GLM)** to the counts  
4. 🧪 **Tests for significance** using the Wald test (or LRT, if specified)  
5. 📉 **Adjusts p-values** using False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction  

The result is a table of genes with corresponding **log2 fold changes**, **p-values**, and **adjusted p-values**—ready for interpretation and visualization.

## Python Code

```python
# NOTE: DESeq2 is R-based; in Python, use rpy2 or export results from R.
# Placeholder: Python is used only for downstream visualizations once DE results are saved.
```

---

## R Code

The following code is included in the script `scripts/res-df.R`:

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(DESeq2)

# 🔄 Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(42)

# 🔹 Load data
counts <- read_csv("data/demo_counts.csv") %>%
  column_to_rownames("gene")
metadata <- read_csv("data/demo_metadata.csv")

# 🧬 Create DESeq2 object
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = counts,
                              colData = metadata,
                              design = ~ condition)

# ⚙️ Run DE analysis
dds <- DESeq(dds)

# 📋 Extract results
res <- results(dds)

# 🧼 Clean and organize results
res_df <- as.data.frame(res) %>%
  rownames_to_column("gene") %>%
  arrange(padj)

# 💾 Save for downstream visualization (if not already saved)
if (!file.exists("data/deseq2_results.csv")) {
  write_csv(res_df, "data/deseq2_results.csv")
}

# 👁️ Preview top results
head(res_df, 5)
```

To execute the analysis before continuing to the downstream Q&A, run this on the command line:

```bash
Rscript scripts/res-df.R
```

> ✅ **Takeaway:** DESeq2 provides robust statistical testing for identifying differentially expressed genes. Always inspect and sort results by adjusted p-value (`padj`) to focus on the most significant findings.

### What the Script Does {-}

> 🔧 The script performs the following:
> - Loads `counts.csv` and `metadata.csv`  
> - Runs DESeq2 for differential expression analysis  
> - Saves cleaned outputs to the `data/` folder  

---

### Output Files {-}

After running the script, your `data/` folder will contain:

- ✅ `demo_counts.csv` — the (optionally cleaned) count matrix  
- ✅ `demo_metadata.csv` — the sample metadata  
- ✅ `deseq2_results.csv` — DESeq2 differential expression results
