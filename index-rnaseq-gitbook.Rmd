# (PART) PREFACE {-}

# 🌱 Welcome to the RNA-Seq Q&A Guide {-}

This guide is your hands-on companion for learning and applying RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data analysis — one question at a time.

You'll explore each step of the RNA-Seq pipeline using real tools, reproducible workflows, and well-commented code. From quality control and quantification to differential expression and biological interpretation, this guide shows how scripting, statistics, and bioinformatics come together in practice.

Whether you’re a student, researcher, or self-taught enthusiast, you’ll gain confidence using Python, R, shell scripting, and reproducible workflows — including tools like **DESeq2**, **Salmon**, **edgeR**, **FastQC**, **Snakemake**, and more.

Each Q&A includes a clear explanation, relevant code in both Python and R when applicable, and builds toward real-world problem solving. You're not just learning RNA-Seq — you're learning to think like a modern data-driven bioinformatician.

## 🌐 The CDI Learning Path {-}

This guide is part of the **Complex Data Insights (CDI)** learning system — a fully free and open-source project licensed under the MIT License.

CDI breaks down complex topics into four progressive layers, designed to be explored individually or as an integrated journey:

- 🔍 **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**  
  Understand your data — explore its structure, patterns, and quirks.

- 📊 **VIZ (Visualization)**  
  Communicate findings through clear and compelling visuals.

- 📐 **STATS (Statistical Analysis)**  
  Test hypotheses and quantify uncertainty using sound statistical methods.

- 🤖 **ML (Machine Learning)**  
  Build models to predict, classify, and uncover deeper insights.

**CDI helps you grow — one Q&A at a time.**

# 📂 What kind of data will you be using in this guide? {-}

This guide uses **realistic synthetic RNA-Seq data** that mimics biological experiments with two conditions (e.g., *Positive* vs. *Negative*). The dataset includes:

- 🧬 A **gene expression count matrix** with 1000 genes and 14 samples  
- 📑 A **sample metadata file** defining experimental groups  
- 📈 Precomputed **differential expression results** using DESeq2

The synthetic design allows full control over expression patterns while producing biologically meaningful visualizations like PCA, volcano plots, MA plots, and heatmaps. It’s perfect for reproducible learning — no downloads or cloud access required.

> ✅ Once you've mastered the methods here, you’ll be ready to plug in your own raw or processed RNA-Seq data and apply the same analysis flow confidently.
